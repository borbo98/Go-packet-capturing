# Go-packet-capturing

This project is for education purposes only.

A Go program, that helps with intercepting packets in Man in the middle attacks.
Prerequisites are, that the router and victim machine have been successfully ARP spoofed.

The program currently only works with capturing packets over http, so it will not work with https. SSLstrip would be requried for that.
